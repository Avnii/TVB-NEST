#Co-simulation Between TVb and NEST
## Concept 
This is a prof of concept for the co-simulation between TVB and NEST.
It should be flexible and scalable to adapt to any networks simulation and run in supercomputers.

WARNING : this code has some bugs and missing elements.
WARNING : All the script needs to be launch in the repertory where there are.

## Installation and update :<a name="installalation"></a>
### Advice for using the repertory :<a name="advice"></a>
For cloning the project, you need also to clone the submodule.
I advice you to clone the repertory with the following command :  git clone --recurse-submodules 

For updating the folder, you need also to update the submodule by the following command: git submodule update

### Different Installation :<a name="diff_install"></a>
In the folder installation, you have three possibilities : 
- docker :
    There are one script for creating a docker image and one script for running a example of usage of this image.
    There are the possibility of two different OS : alpine (1) and debian (2)
- singularity : 
    The same function for docker are available for singularity
- virtual environment :
    There are one script for create a virtual environment with all the python library for running the script.
    WARNING : the library for PyNest are not available in this environment. You should compile Nest and add the path of the library in the PYTHONPATH before to use it.

If you want to install in your computer, you should look the configuration file of singularity.
This are only possibility and not a formal way to install and to use this git repository.
To test your installation, you should look the section Test or the folder test_nest

## Dependencies<a name="dependencies"></a>
Nest : the version of Nest is base of Nest 3 is already included in the repertory
        For the dependency of nest, you should look this page : https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/linux_install.html
        For having the good configuration parameters of Nest, you should look this page : https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/install_options.html
        I use the next commands for compiling nest :
        mkdir ./lib/nest_run
        mkdir ./lib/nest_build
        cd  ./lib/nest_build
        cmake ../../nest-io-dev/ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH='../lib/nest_run/' -Dwith-python=3 -Dwith-mpi=ON -Dwith-openmp=ON -Dwith-debug=ON
        make 
MPI : MPI need to be MPI-3 ( I use the following implementation : http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/3.1.4/mpich-3.1.4.tar.gz)

Python library :
1. TVB version >=2.0
2. numpy
3. mpi4py
5. threading
6. scipy
7. json
9. numba
10. quantities
11. elephant
12. neo

## Adaption to your own usage<a name="usages"></a>
### The management of parameters or change parameters:<a name="usages_1"></a>
 The file nest_elephant_nest/simulation/parameters_managers.py which manage the modification of parameters of the exploration and the link between parameters.
 If you want to change a parameters, you should be careful of the dependency between parameters ( see the file test_parameters ).
 If you want to explore a particular parameters, you should be careful of the name of parameters and the real modification of it.
 
### If you want to modify the Nest configuration:<a name="usages_2"></a>
You should change the file nest_elephant_nest/simulation/simulation_nest.py
The most important of this file is the the function at the end call for the run exploration.
There are 5 step : 
- Configure Nest
- Create the population of neurons
- Create the connection between population 
- Create the device (WARNING: this function need to send the ID's of device using MPI. This ids are used for the configutation of the translators)
- Simulate

The 4 first step are the initialisation of Nest.
If you include or remove the parameters of Nest, you need to change nest_elephant_nest/simulation/parameters_managers.py for remove the link between parameters.
Moreover, the name of the parameters need to begin by 'param'.  

### If you want to modify TVB configuration:<a name="usages_3"></a>
You should change the beginning of the file nest_elephant_nest/simulation/simulation_zerlaut.py
The function init create the simulator for running TVB. All the parameters are use in this file.
The dependency with the parameter of Nest are define in nest_elephant_nest/simulation/parameters_managers.py. 

## Tests<a name="tests"></a>
### How to test the installation (don't the correctness of the simulation)<a name="tests_1"></a>
Before every test include in your python path the folder and the installation of Nest

Example/test of the different modules
1. Nest :
    1. test_nest/test_input_nest_current.sh
    2. test_nest/test_input_nest_current_multiple.sh (test also the multi-threading)
    3. test_nest/test_input_nest_spike.sh 
    4. test_nest/test_record_nest_spike.sh
    5. test_nest/test_record_nest_spike_multiple.sh (test also the multi-threading) 
2. test_nest/test_translator_nest_to_tvb.sh
3. test_nest/test_translator_tvb_to_nest.sh
4. test_nest/test_nest_save.sh

Test only nest : run_nest_one.py (for 1 region in Nest but it can be easily extend to 112 regions)
Test only tvb : run_tvb_one.py (for 1 region in TVB but it can be easily extend to 112 regions)

For testing the co-simulation, you can check : 
    - test_nest/test_co-sim.sh
    - install/docker/run_image.sh
    - install/singularity/run_image.sh

## Future implementation :<a name="future"></a>
1. Improve the communication pattern for the input of Nest
2. Install on cluster
3. Add a second function to transform rate to spike based on Multiple Interaction Process Model
4. Improve synchronisation between modules (actually file synchronization).
5. Add test for the input an output of interface TVB.
6. Add test for valid the value a simulation
7. Add some functions of the simulation Nest to include multimeter recorder and other stimuli. 

## Extension :<a name="extension"></a>
1. Replace the output of simulator by a streaming output function.
2. Replace the device in Nest by include the input direct in the neurons 
3. Create an orchestrator for managing communication of MPI and the synchronisation between all the elements
